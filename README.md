- It contains deployments for Kubernetes Cluster and its pre-requisites for different Cloud providers.
- It uses the [Docker Labs](https://github.com/carlosrodlop/docker-labs) repository to run its content and make this content portable.

## Common Principles

- [Pre-commits](.pre-commit-config.yaml) for Security, Validations and Documentation
